Version 2.1 - 5/2/2011
-------------------------
Core plugin code was completely rewritten for comprehension and for easier long-term support. The original API was unchanged, except with the addition of several new features. Added latitude_field, longitude_field, and zoom_field to pull the respective values from a specified channel. Plot or center on a static longitude and latitude coordinate. Now able to add multiple static addresses. The only required field is now the id. A lot of rules were changes in how data interacts with the map. If the address or coordinates are blank coming from the channel, the record is ignored. You can define a single channel that stores address and coordinates and plot them on a single map. The idea of the upgrade was to be less restrictive.
 

Version 2.0 - 4/23/2011
----------------------
Completely revamped the Google Map implementation within the native channel:entries tag instead of using a proprietary syntax. Google Maps v3.0 API was used instead of 2.0 which comes with mobile support. All v3.0 options are available.
