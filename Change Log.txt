Version 2.1.3 5/9/2011
----------------------
Added the ability to search custom fields like the inherent exp:channel:entries tag. (search:custom_field="some value").


Version 2.1.2 5/9/2011
----------------------
Fixed the a problem the with double-quotes breaking the javascript. The markup that is now inserted into the info window is now escaped.


Version 2.1.1 5/5/2011
----------------------
Fixed a typo the caused a JavaScript error in IE that resulted in the maps not displaying properly.


Version 2.1 - 5/2/2011
----------------------
Core plugin code was completely rewritten for comprehension and for easier long-term support. The original API was unchanged, except with the addition of several new features. Added latitude_field, longitude_field, and zoom_field to pull the respective values from a specified channel. Plot or center on a static longitude and latitude coordinate. Now able to add multiple static addresses. The only required field is now the id. A lot of rules were changes in how data interacts with the map. If the address or coordinates are blank coming from the channel, the record is ignored. You can define a single channel that stores address and coordinates and plot them on a single map. The idea of the upgrade was to be less restrictive.


Version 2.0 - 4/23/2011
----------------------
Completely revamped the Google Map implementation within the native channel:entries tag instead of using a proprietary syntax. Google Maps v3.0 API was used instead of 2.0 which comes with mobile support. All v3.0 options are available.
